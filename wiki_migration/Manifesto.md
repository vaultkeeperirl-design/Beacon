# THE BEACON MANIFESTO

## 1. NO FREELOADERS
This is not a charity. This is not a "free" service funded by your data.
Beacon is a living organism. If you want to consume, you must contribute.
Every viewer is a node. Every stream is a shared responsibility.
You don't just watch; you carry the signal.

## 2. DECENTRALIZATION IS SURVIVAL
Centralized platforms are fragile. They are choke points for censorship and corporate greed.
We are building a hydra. Cut off one head, and the network routes around it.
There is no "kill switch" for the swarm.

## 3. BRUTAL BUT FAIR
We don't promise comfort. We promise fairness.
If your internet is trash, your experience will be trash. We don't hide the reality of the network.
But if you contribute, you earn. Bandwidth is currency.
Meritocracy is the only law.

## 4. CODE IS LAW
Trust no one. Verify everything.
Our protocols are open. Our logic is transparent.
The rules are written in code, not in Terms of Service agreements that change at a whim.

## 5. LIGHT THE BEACON
We are the alternative. The orange pill.
Join the mesh. Be the signal.
