## 2024-02-28 - Initial Documentation Assessment
**Learning:** The project has solid high-level docs (Architecture, Installation) but lacks a deep-dive, user-friendly explanation of its most unique features: the P2P Mesh, bandwidth relay, and the Credit economy.
**Action:** Created `how-beacon-works.md` to explain the bandwidth relay mechanisms and how the backend calculates credits securely to give users and contributors a better mental model.
