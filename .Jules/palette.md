## 2024-05-23 - Video Player Accessibility
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons in video players are a common accessibility trap. Without `aria-label` or `title` attributes, they are completely invisible to screen reader users, making the core functionality of the app inaccessible.
**Action:** Always audit video player controls first. Ensure every interactive element has a descriptive `aria-label` that reflects its current state (e.g., "Pause" vs "Play").
