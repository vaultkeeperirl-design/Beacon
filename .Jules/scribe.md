## 2024-03-01 - Documenting Core WebRTC/P2P Hooks
**Learning:** The application's complex P2P mesh logic (connecting nodes, signaling, pooling stats) is centralized in a few hooks like `useP2PStream.js` and `useRealP2PStats.js`. These functions have significant impacts on the platform's core mechanics (mandatory bandwidth sharing) but lacked explicit inline API documentation, making it difficult for new agents or humans to trace the data flow or usage of these hooks safely.
**Action:** Added comprehensive JSDoc to `useP2PStream` and `subscribeToMeshStats` explaining their parameters, return values, and overall architecture responsibilities (broadcasting vs relaying). Reviewed `useRealP2PStats` to ensure its existing JSDoc adequately described the underlying stat polling and calculation rules.
