# Features

**Beacon** is packed with features designed for a decentralized streaming future.

## Core Features

### 1. Decentralized P2P Streaming
-   **Mesh Network**: Streams are distributed across a network of viewers (nodes) rather than a central server farm.
-   **No Gatekeepers**: Content is delivered directly from peer to peer.
-   **Scalability**: The more people watch, the stronger the network becomes.

### 2. Mandatory Bandwidth Sharing ("The Cost of Entry")
-   **Contribution**: Every viewer must contribute upload bandwidth to relay the stream to others.
-   **Fairness**: Prevents "freeloading" and ensures the network remains robust.

### 3. Incentivized Contribution (Credits)
-   **Earn While You Watch**: Viewers earn credits for relaying data to other peers.
-   **Reward System**: High-quality relay nodes are rewarded with a share of ad revenue or platform tokens.

### 4. Co-Streaming Revenue
-   **Collaboration**: Hosts can invite guests to co-stream.
-   **Revenue Splits**: Earnings are automatically split between the host and guests based on smart contracts (or platform logic).
-   **Team Building**: Encourages streamers to work together rather than compete.

### 5. Real-Time Chat
-   **Interactive**: Viewers can chat in real-time with the broadcaster and other viewers.
-   **Integration**: Chat is integrated alongside the stream for seamless interaction.

### 6. "Orange" Branding
-   **Identity**: A distinct visual style (Orange/Amber gradients) separates Beacon from competitors.
-   **Community**: A strong community-driven ethos focused on freedom and decentralization.

## Planned Features (Roadmap)

-   **Crypto Wallet Integration**: Seamless payments and withdrawals for earnings.
-   **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed stats on bandwidth usage, peers connected, and stream health.
-   **Governance**: Community voting on platform upgrades and policies.
